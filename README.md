# arduino-chess-clock
Chess countdown timer for the Arduino, using an LCD keypad shield.

The LCD keypad handling code is based on [a sample](http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php?title=Arduino_LCD_KeyPad_Shield_%28SKU:_DFR0009%29) on how to use the LCD keypad.

The countdown timer has three screens.

1. A timer screen to show the remaining time for each player.

2. A menu screen for setting the number of minutes available for each player.

3. A game over screen, displayed when either player runs out of time.
